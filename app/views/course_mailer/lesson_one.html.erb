<span style="font-weight: 700">What is Bitcoin and why Bitcoin at all?</span>
<br><br>
Bitcoin is the worlds first peer to peer electronic cash system as described by Satoshi Nakamoto, the
pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin who till this day remains a mystery to the world, in his original
whitepaper in 2008.
<br><br>
With Bitcoin price going from $1 per 1,300 BTC to $5000 per BTC, it has gained attention of the whole
world especially internet users and the question still remains what is Bitcoin and why is it important ?
Bitcoin make use of an immutable ledger technology known as the Blockchain which makes it possible to
transfer value from one person to another over the internet with the use of a smartphone or computer at a
very small cost and without any middle man or central authority mediating the transaction.<br><br> Bitcoin is
important because it is the first decentralized peer to peer digital currency not controlled or own by any
government. It is powered by it’s user community who donate their computing power to process, validate
and enter transactions into it’s ledger, a process which is called mining.<br><br> In return miners get
rewarded in Bitcoin ( this is also the only way new Bitcoins are made.) It was the first practical
implementation and is the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in the world. Also, Bitcoin
and it’s underlying Blockchain technology is doing to money what email did to snail mail.
<br><br>
The total number of Bitcoin that will ever be in existence is 21 million units. Because of it’s deflationary
nature, it has been different things to different people in it’s relatively short lifespan. It was first a medium
of exchange thus it’s use as a peer to peer digital cash, then it became a hedge against real world financial
uncertainties because it’s not affected by fiscal and monetary policies of any one government.<br><br> It has been
dubbed the future of money, others think just as gold is a hedge against real world financial uncertainties,
Bitcoin is the digital gold in this digital era. The unit of account of Bitcoin is BTC.
<br><br>
A Bitcoin transaction can be compared to sending an email. It involves the public key which is also
known as address or wallet address of the receiver, where the Bitcoin is received. It is also called the
public key because you give out just like your email address, it is fine for people to see it.<br><br> The sender uses
his public key and his private keys, think of it as logging into your Gmail with your email (public key)
and password (private keys) to send an email, in this case, Bitcoin. Note however, that, passwords can be
recovered but priavate keys cannot.<br><br> Bitcoins are kept in a Bitcoin wallet. In other to spend Bitcoin, one
will need to have access to the private keys of the wallet which contains Bitcoin.
