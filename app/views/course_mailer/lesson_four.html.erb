<span style="font-weight: 700">Why we believe in Bitcoin and some Alt coins.</span>
<br><br>
Mobile money has made it possible to set up shop and do business from all over the country right ? Even
a simple Instagram or Whatsapp group, even Facebook can be monetized! Imagine being able to set up
shop for physical or virtual goods on the internet and having a worldwide customer base without a middle
man and little to no fees for both seller and buyer. With unfathomable speed and having the chance to be
your own bank. Your money does not lose it’s purchasing power to time like government backed money
because cryptocurrencies are deflationary by nature. This is the power cryptocurrencies hold.
<br><br>
Bitcoin is the first of it’s kind and many others have been created to fix the flaws that plague Bitcoin in
it’s quest to become a digital peer to peer cash system of the world. It has so far achieved much success
being a store of value and a gateway into the world of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, fiat must be
exchanged into Bitcoin, the gateway currency in other to buy altcoins.
<br><br>
Bitcoin and altcoins are close to bridging the gap which forms the digital divide often referenced between
Africa and the rest of the world. (Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin.) Never before has
there been so much opportunity to take advantage of ecommerce ideas that were never possible to
monetize because of payment processors eating into already low margins of profit of businesses with their
fees.
<br><br>
Morever, government backed currencies are inflationary by nature and can never be a store of value.
That’s not what it was intended for. But lack of a better choice only makes people run from one
government backed currency to the other in search of safety.
<br><br>
On the other hand, for most of us banks represent money store houses where we save and invest our
money. But this is never the case as we witnessed from the recent happenings in 2013 in Cyprus where
depositors where being charged 6% or more tax on their own money by the government to bail out
struggling banks. Recently, two Ghanaian banks by name UT Bank and Capital Bank went under before
we could even deal with the DKM scandal.<br><br> Even though I haven’t heard of depositors losing money in the
collapse of the two banks because their assets and liability was absorb by the Ghana Commercial Bank, it
shows clearly that banks, do fail too. In the event mentioned above, Cyproits took a more radical
approach, instead of withdrawing their money and stuffing it under their mattress they removed it entirely
out of the clutches of bankers and government.<br><br> A few days later, there was a surge in the price of Bitcoin.
Later that year in November, University of Nicosia in Cyprus became the first university to accept Bitcoin
payments.<br><br>Cryptocurrencies take the power and give it back to the people. Because one does not need to
trust a third party to keep their lifesavings for them.
<br><br>
They do not seek in be used entirely and displace government backed money. It merely give us a choice
in times of financial uncertainty or failure in the financial order of the day.

<br><br>
