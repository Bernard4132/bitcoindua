    Hello <%= @crytosubscription.name %>,<br> 
 
<br><br>
By now you’ve heard all the rage and media hype about Bitcoin and you’re probably thinking if you should take a plunge and see what this unbelievable ROI truly is. You’re not alone ! Many people day by day take a leap into Internet 2.0 in hopes of attaining financial freedom. This is evident as Coinbase, the most famous app for buying Bitcoin around the world becomes the top most searched app on the AppStore.

<br><br>

Truth be told it’s easier to lose your hard earned money as a new guy on the crypto block than 10x your investment capital like you dream of.

<br><br>

There’s more than one thousand different cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin known as altcoins and a new one launching everyday, of this one thousand cryptocurrencies about 50% of them are vaporware! Yes you heard me right, VAPORWARE!!

<br><br>

Vaporware are projects without a minimum viable product, they have only a concept of what they hope to achieve and most of them have massive valuations. Their tokens are only good for speculation and nothing more! Now, there are another group of cryptocurrencies which is referred to as shitcoins. These are projects that doesn’t have any significance! Some are even dead coins which developers have abandoned yet they’re traded on the market.

<br><br>

With the media calling cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin a bubble waiting to pop I believe you would want to be a value investor. And invest in cryptocurrencies and crypto assets with developers, a solid team with a track record and a product.
